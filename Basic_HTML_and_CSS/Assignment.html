		<blockquote cite="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dachshund/">
		“Dachshund” is a German word meaning “badger dog,” and the breed’s German history goes back some 600 years.
		And, as the breed name suggests, the Dachshund was developed to enthusiastically dig his way into a badger den and dispatch its occupant. 
		The Dachshund’s long, low body was custom-made for this dirty subterranean work.
